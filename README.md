# Time_Series_Analysis (Stock pric forcasting)
Stock price forecasting is important in finance and economics, but it has been regarded as one of the most challenging applications.

Three different methods were implemented to predict the stock price using Microsoft historical stock price. 

The first method was seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model, which is one of the most widely used model traditionally. 

The second model was Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which is considered as non-linear statistical data tool and it can learn the underlying patterns from the data (Jabin, 2014; Rather et al., 2015; Hiransha et al., 2018). 

The third model is Prophet from Facebook which is developed very recently (Tylor and Letham, 2017). P

redictions from each model compared to the actual stock price and model evaluation metrics were used to compare the different models.
